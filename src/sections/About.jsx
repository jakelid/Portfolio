        <p className="muted">Computer science student focused on practical, maintainable software. My core toolkit is Spring Boot, Java, Python, and C++, and I ground my work in the basics: algorithmic thinking, complexity trade-offs, data modeling with SQL, API design, and solid version control practices. I enjoy shaping the user experience while keeping implementation details cleanâ€”tests first where it counts, small PRs, and clear documentation so future me (and teammates) can move faster.</p>
