        <p className="muted">I’m a computer science undergrad who enjoys building smooth UI/UX backed by solid engineering. I’ve worked on interactive graphics (C++/OpenGL), full‑stack web apps, and data‑driven tooling. Outside of classes, I lead finance initiatives and mentor peers, blending technical depth with practical impact.</p>
